# test/shared

This directory contains shared files that are used by multiple tests.

The files in this directory are not intended to be used directly by users of the library. They are used by the tests in the `test` directory.

## Do not add files or changes that are used in single tests

Those should be added to their corresponding test directory until there is a need for it to be shared.
