# Data Grid - Localization

<p class="description">The Date Grid will support users from different locale, with formating, RTL, and localized strings.</p>

## Locale text

The grid will support localization with a single prop that includes all the translated messages.
You will be able to follow [this guide](/guides/localization/#locale-text) to use them.

You can use the `localeText` prop to pass in your own text and translations. The default translations are for en-US.
