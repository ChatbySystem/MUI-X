# Data Grid - Pagination

<p class="description">Through paging, a segment of data can be viewed from the assigned data source.</p>

> ⚠️ The data grid components are supporting v5 and v4. However, no documentation is available for v5 yet. You can use the [documentation of v4](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/) instead.
