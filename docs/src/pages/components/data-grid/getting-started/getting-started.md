# Data Grid - Getting started

<p class="description">Get started with the last React data grid you will need. Install the package, configure the columns, provide rows and you are set.</p>

> ⚠️ The data grid components are supporting v5 and v4. However, no documentation is available for v5 yet. You can use the [documentation of v4](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/) instead.
