# Data Grid - Getting started

<p class="description">Get started with the last React data grid you will need. Install the package, configure the columns, provide rows and you are set.</p>

> ⚠️ This feature is only available in v4, head to the [v4 documentation page](https://material-ui.com/components/data-grid/) for more details.
>
> You can follow [issue #441](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui-x/issues/441) to be notified once we migrate the data grid from v4 to v5.
