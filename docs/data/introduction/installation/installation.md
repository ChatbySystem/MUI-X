# Installation

<p class="description">Install the necessary packages to start building with MUI X components.</p>

MUI X packages are available through the free MIT-licensed Community Plan, or the commercially-licensed Pro and Premium Plans.
See [the licensing page](/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

Note that you only need to install the packages corresponding to the components you're usingâ€”e.g. Data Grid users don't need to install Date and Time Pickers.

## Dependencies

MUI X components have a peer dependency on `@mui/material`.
To install Material UI, run:

With **npm**:

```sh
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

With **yarn**

```sh
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

Material UI uses Emotion as its default style library.
If you prefer styled-components, run:

With **npm**

```sh
npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
```

With **yarn**

```sh
yarn add @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
```
