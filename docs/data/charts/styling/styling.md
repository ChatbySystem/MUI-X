# Charts - Styling

<p class="description">This page groups topics about charts customization.</p>

## Colors

### Series color

Series accepts a property `color` which is the base color used to render its components.

```jsx
<LineChart series={[{ ..., color: '#fdb462'}]} />
```

{{"demo": "BasicColor.js"}}

### Color palette

Charts come with built-in color palettes to automatically assign colors to series.
If a particular series lacks a color prop, the chart will default to assigning a color based on the series' index.

You can set a custom color palette by using the prop `colors` on chart components (or `<ChartContainer />` if you are using composition).
This prop takes an array of colors, or callback whose input is the theme's mode (`'dark'` or `'light'`) and returns the array of colors.

#### Provided palettes

The library includes three palettes.

{{"demo": "MuiColorTemplate.js"}}

#### Custom palettes

Those palettes can also be generated by using [d3-scale-chromatic](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes).
Or any color manipulation library you like.

Here is an example of the d3 Categorical color palette.

{{"demo": "ColorTemplate.js"}}

### Values color

Colors can also be set according to item values.
To do so, use the `colorMap` property of the corresponding axis.

Learn more on how to use this feature with each chart component on their dedicated docs section:

- [bar charts](/x/react-charts/bars/#color-scale)
- [line charts](/x/react-charts/lines/#color-scale)
- [scatter charts](/x/react-charts/scatter/#color-scale)

The `colorMap` property can accept three kind of objects defined below.

#### Piecewise color map

The piecewise configuration takes an array of N `thresholds` values, and N+1 `colors`.

```ts
{
  type: 'piecewise';
  thresholds: Value[];
  colors: string[];
}
```

#### Continuous color map

The continuous configuration allows to map values from `min` to `max` properties, to it's color.

The `color` property can either be an array of two colors to interpolate.
Or directly an interpolation function that for a number `t` between 0 and 1 returns a color.
The [d3-scale-chromatic](https://d3js.org/d3-scale-chromatic) offers a lot of those functions.

Values lower than the `min` get the color of the `min` value.
Same for values higher than the `max`.
By default the `min`/`max` range is set to 0 / 100.

```ts
{
  type: 'continuous';
  min?: Value;
  max?: Value;
  color: [string, string] | ((t: number) => string);
}
```

#### Ordinal color map

This configuration takes two properties: `values` and `colors`.
And will result in a mapping of those values to the colors.

If a value is not defined, it will fall back to the `unknownColor`.
Which fall back on the series color if undefined.

This configuration can be used in bar charts to set colors according to string categories.

```ts
{
  type: 'ordinal';
  values: Value[];
  colors: string[];
  unknownColor?: string;
}
```

## Styling

### Size

By default, charts adapt their sizing to fill their parent element.
However, you can modify this behavior by providing `height` and/or `width` props.

Those will fix the chart's size to the given value (in px).

### Placement

At the core of chart layout is the drawing area which corresponds to the space available to represent data.

This space can be defined with the `margin` prop and its properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
Those values define the space between the SVG border and the drawing area.

You might want to modify those values to leave more space for your axis ticks or reduce them to provide more space for the data.

{{"demo": "MarginNoSnap.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "playground"}}

### CSS

Since the library relies on SVG for rendering, you can customize them as you do with other MUIÂ System components with CSS overriding.

Chart components accept the `sx` props.
From here, you can target any subcomponents with its class name.
