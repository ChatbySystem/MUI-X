# Charts - Legend

<p class="description">Legend is the UI element mapping symbols and colors to the series' label.</p>

## Basic display

In chart components, the legend links series with `label` properties and their color.

## Placement

The legend can either be displayed in `column` or `row` layout.

It can also be moved by a combination of `position: {vertical, horizontal}` and the legend offset values.
The `position` places the legend tight to the drawing area, and offset values move it relative to this base position.

Defaults are such that the legend is placed on top of the charts.
