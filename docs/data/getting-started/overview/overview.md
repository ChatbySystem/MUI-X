# MUI X - Overview

<p class="description">MUI X is a collection of advanced React UI components for complex use cases.</p>

## Introduction

MUI X is a collection of advanced UI components, including our [Data Grid](/x/react-data-grid) and [Date and Time Pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started).

These components are significantly more complex than anything found in the MUI Core libraries, and feature advanced functionality for data-heavy applications and a wide range of other use cases.

> **Note:** MUI X is **open core**â€”base components are MIT-licensed, while more advanced features require a Pro or Premium commercial license.
> See [Licensing](/x/getting-started/licensing/) for details.
>
> Thoughout the documentation, Pro- and Premium-only features are denoted with the [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/material-ui-pro/) and [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/material-ui-premium/) icons, respectively.

## MUI X vs. MUI Core

MUI X is a collection of advanced UI components for complex use cases.

MUI Core contains foundational UI component libraries like Material UI and MUI Base.
These libraries are open source, MIT-licensed, and free forever.

Most of MUI X's components are available for free with an MIT license, but more advanced features require a Pro or Premium commercial license.

MUI X components are fully compatible with MUI Core.
X can extend the functionality of UIs built with Material UI or MUI Base, but its components can also stand on their own.
