## Data Grid

- [ApiRef moved to the MIT open source version](/x/react-data-grid/api-object/)

  Manage pagination, scrolling, state, and other attributes through the Data Grid's API objectâ€” previously only in commercial plans, now available for all.

- [Improved column menu](/x/react-data-grid/column-menu/)

  The v6 column menu now provides support for icons, menu groups, custom items and actions, and more.
  This subcomponent was redesigned to be as extensible as possible.

- [Cell range selection](/x/react-data-grid/cell-selection/) [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan)

  Select a cell or group of cells like in an Excel sheet.
  Cell selection is a powerful and flexible way to select data in the Data Grid.
  It's also the base for bulk editing and clipboard importing (coming soon).

- [Use web workers to export data to excel files](/x/react-data-grid/export/#using-a-web-worker). [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan)

  Instead of generating the Excel file in the main thread, you can use a web worker in the background to allow interactions with the grid while the data is exported.

- Stable [Aggregation](/x/react-data-grid/aggregation/) [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan) and [Row pinning](/x/react-data-grid/row-pinning/) [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

  These two features have been previously released in a minor v5 version under the `experimentalFeatures` flag. Now they are officially stable.

## Date and Time pickers

- [Fields: the new default input for pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/fields/).

  These rich text fields are specialized for date and time logic and offer quick navigation and isolated interaction within each section of a date value.

- [Improved layout customization](/x/react-date-pickers/custom-layout/)

  Combining the slots concept with the grid layout, you can now rearrange, extend, and customize most of the subcomponents used in the Pickers UI.

- [Shortcuts for picking specific dates in a calendar](/x/react-date-pickers/shortcuts/)

  Add quick and customizable shortcuts for your users. Particularly useful for date ranges.
  Display them on the left, right, bottom, or top.

- [Edit date ranges with drag and drop](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-calendar/) [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

  Editing a date range is even easier now with the new drag-and-drop interface. ChangeÂ `start`Â andÂ `end`Â dates at will.
