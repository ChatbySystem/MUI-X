# Localized dates

<p class="description">Use localized format to render your dates.</p>

## Getting started

The Date and Time Pickers allow you to override the locale used to format the dates.
By default, each library uses the `en-US` locale.

## Set a custom locale

### With `dayjs`

For `dayjs`, you just have to import the locale and then pass its name to the `LocalizationProvider` as shown below:

{{"demo": "LocalizationDayjs.js"}}

### With `date-fns`

For `date-fns`

{{"demo": "LocalizationDateFns.js"}}

### With `luxon`

### With `moment`

## Set a custom date format
