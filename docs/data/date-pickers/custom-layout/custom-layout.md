# Custom layout

<p class="description">The date picker lets you reorganize its layout</p>

## Default layout structure

By default, pickers are made of 3 sub elements present in the following order:

- The **toolbar** displaying the selected date. Can be enforced with `showToolbar` prop.
- The **content** that includes the current view, and the tabs to switch between views if necessary.
- The **action bar** allowing some interactions. Can be added with [`componentsProps.actionBar`](/x/react-date-pickers/custom-components/#action-bar) porp.

You can [customize those components](/x/react-date-pickers/custom-components/) individually by using `components` and `componentsProps`.

### Orientation

Toggling layout can be achieved by changing `orientation` prop value between `'portrait'` or `'landscape'`.

Here is a demonstration with the 3 components outlined with color borders.

## Customize layout

### Understanding the structure

The layout is structured as follows:

A `<LayoutRoot />` component wraps all the sub-components to provide the structure.
By default it renders a `div` with `display: grid`.
Such that all sub-components take place into a 3 by 3 [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).

Subcomponents are wrapped inside layout helper, responsible for placing it into the grid.
Here is an overview of the structure.

```jsx
<LayoutRoot>
  // Toolbar
  <LayoutToolbar>
    <Toolbar />
  </LayoutToolbar>
  // Content
  <LayoutContent>
    <Tabs />
    <View />
  </LayoutContent>
  // Action bar
  <LayoutActionBar>
    <ActionBar />
  </LayoutActionBar>
</LayoutRoot>
```

### Element positions

To move an elementâ€”the easiest way is to override it's wrapper position with [`gridColumn`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column) and [`gridRow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row) properties.

In the next example, the action bar is replaced by a list, and placed at the right of the component.
Placing at the right is achieved by applying `{ gridColumn: 3, gridRow: 2 }` style.

### Accessibility

In the demonstration above, the layout is modified thanks to CSS.
Such modification can lead to inconsistencies between the visual aspect, and the DOM structure.
In the previous demonstration, the tab order is broken, because the action bar appears before the calendar whereas in the DOM the action bar is still after the calendar.

To reorder the DOM structure, you can use the layout callback.
It gives you access to the main parts of the layout: `toolbar`, `content`, `actionBar` and you can order them in the `children` property.

```jsx
componentsProps={{
  layout: ({toolbar, content, actionBar}) =>({
    sx: {
      /* CSS reordering */
    },
    children: [toolbar, actionBar, content ]
  }),
}}
```

Here is the previous demonstration with a fix for the tabulation order.

### Adding Elements

You can use the strategy explained above to add extra elements in the layout.
