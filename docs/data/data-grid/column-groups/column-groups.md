# Data grid - Column groups

<p class="description">Group your columns.</p>

Grouping columns allows you to have multiple levels of columns in your header and to toggle column groups to show and hide additional columns.

## Define column grouping

You can define the column grouping structure by providing the `columnGroupingModel` prop to the grid.
This prop receives an array of column groups.

A column group is defined by at least two properties:

- `groupId`: a string used to identify the group
- `children`: an array containing the children of the group

The `children` attribute can contain two types of objects:

- leafs with type `{ field: string }`, which add the column with the corresponding `field` to this group.
- other column groups which allows you to have nested groups.

:::warning
A column can only be associated with one group.
:::

```jsx
columnGroupingModel={[
    {
        groupId: "internal",
        children: [{ field: "id" }]
    },
    {
        groupId: "character",
        children: [
            {
                groupId: "naming",
                children: [
                    { field: "lastName" },
                    { field: "firstName" },
                ]
            },
            { field: "age" }
        ]
    }
]}
```

## Customize column group

In addition to the required `groupId` and `children`, you can add extra properties to a column group object to customize it:

- `headerName`: the sting displayed instead of `groupId`.
- `description`: a longer string displayed in a tooltip.
- `renderHeaderGroup`: a function returning custom React component.

## Column reordering [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/mui-x-pro/)

By default, column groups can not be divided when reordering columns.
This default behavior can be removed on specific group by setting `freeReordering: true` in the column group object.

In the example bellow the `Character` column group can be divided, but not other column groups

The column group should allow to switch between an extended/collapsed view which hide/show some columns
