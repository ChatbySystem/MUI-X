# Tree View - JSX children

<p class="description">Pass data to your Tree View using JSX.</p>

If your Tree View has fixed data that do not come from a database, you can use the `SimpleTreeView` component that takes JSX children instead of a `items` prop.

However, if `SimpleTreeView` is too limited for your usage, have a look at the `TreeView` component and the other pages of this documentation.

## Basic usage

{{"demo": "BasicJSXTreeView.js"}}

## Disabled items

{{"demo": "BasicDisabledJSXItems.js"}}
