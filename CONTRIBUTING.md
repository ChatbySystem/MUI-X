# Contributing to Material-UI X

## Material-UI X vs. Material-UI

Material-UI X is an extension of Material-UI.
The repositories are part of the same codebase.
`mui-org/material-ui-x` imports the code infrastructure from [`mui-org/material-ui`](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui).
You can find the contribution guide of the main repository at [mui-org/material-ui/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Most of the content on the contribution guide of Material-UI applies to this repository.
However, there are a few differences:

- The default GitHub branch might be different.
- The local documentation site opens on a different port: 3001 instead of 3000.
- Contributing on Material-UI X require to sign a CLA.

## Contributor License Agreements

Material-UI SAS is asking all past and future contributors to sign a contributor license agreement.
Every contributor of non-trivial amounts of code (more than just a line or two) to Material-UI X should sign such a document.
If somebody is unable to sign the document, their contribution (whether it be code, or documentation or string translations) may need to be rejected or removed from Material-UI X.

The CLA ensures that Material-UI SAS has clear license to all its contributions, which in turns lets us guarantee to users that we have no "stray" intellectual property or differently-licensed material. This is very similar to the CLA you need to sign to contribute to React: https://code.facebook.com/cla/.

### FAQ

#### Am I giving away the copyright to my contributions?

No. This is a pure license agreement, not a copyright assignment.
You still maintain the full copyright for your contributions.
You are only providing a license to Material-UI SAS to distribute your code without further restrictions.
This is not the case for all CLA's, but it is the case for the one we are using.

#### Can I withdraw permission to use my contributions at a later date?

No. This is one of the reasons we require a CLA. No individual contributor can hold such a threat over the entire community of users.
Once you make a contribution, you are saying we can use that piece of code forever.

#### Can I submit patches without having signed the CLA?

Trivial patches like spelling fixes or missing words in the documentation don't require an agreement, since anybody could do those.
